# mEBA (multivariate Empirical Band Analysis)
Simulated examples and electroencephalography analysis accompanying manuscript ``Frequency Band Analysis of Nonstationary Multivariate Time Series'' by Raanju R. Sundararajan and Scott A. Bruce

R code developed and tested using R version 4.2.2 on both macOS Monterey and Windows 11 operating systems.

## Simulated examples
Separate R scripts are provided to generate simulated time series following the five settings introduced in the manuscript (WN1B, L3B, S3B, M3B-1, and M3B-2).  These files use the naming convention `mEBA_simulatedexamples_abbreviation.R` where abbreviation is the corresponding abbreviation noted above.  These files also include a description of the output from the method and visualizations of output.
